# Font Selector class for Delphi FMX

Created in Delphi 11.2

- Supports collecting fonts from the OS
- Text input with auto-complete for quick font selection without scrolling through the list
- Font style used in the list and edit box for font preview

Currently only tested in Windows, but should in theory work on Mac


Current issues:

Some lag when scrolling through the list when a heavy font is reached (e.g. Surfing Capital). This is true of font selectors in many other apps.
